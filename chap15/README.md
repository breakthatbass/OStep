# Mechanism: Address Translation

1. Run with seeds 1, 2, and 3, and compute whether each virtual address generated by the process is in or out of bounds. If in bounds, compute the translation.

    ```
    # seed 1
    
    va 0, 2, 3, 4: segmentation violation
    va 1: pass, 14145
    ```

    
    ```
    # seed 2

    va 0: pass, 15586  
    va 1: pass, 15615  
    va 2, 3, 4: segmentation violation
    ```

    ```
    # seed 3

    va 0, 1, 2: segmentation violation
    va 3: pass, 8983
    va 4: pass, 8929
    ```

2. Run with these flags: `-s 0 -n 10`. What value do you have set `-l` (the bounds register) to in order to ensure that all the generated virtual addresses are within bounds?


    `./relocation.py -s 0 -n 10 -l 930 -c`

3. Run with these flags: `-s 1 -n 10 -l 100`. What is the maximum value that base can be set to, such that the address space still fits into physical memory in its entirety?

    `16 * 1024 (1k) - 100 = 16284` 
    
4. Run some of the same problems above, but with larger address spaces (`-a`) and physical memories (`-p`).  
    - d.i.y.

5. What fraction of randomly-generated virtual addresses are valid, as a function of the value of the bounds register? Make a graph from running with different random seeds, with limit values ranging from 0 up to the maximum size of the address space.

    - hmmmm. I'll come back to this making a graph thing. moving on for now!
